# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch

The goal of this implementation is to build neural networks from scratch.
Here, we are going to build a MLP, exploring different concepts of Machine Learning,
like normalization, metrics, training etc. 
To train the model build here in C++, we are going to use the digit-reconizer based
on MNIST dataset.
